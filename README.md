# Proxychains Installer
This is a script for installing a compiled version of ProxyChains ver. 4.2.0 by haad on RHEL7/OEL7

I don't know how kosher this is,
but all I've done is compile the proxychains project by haad: 
https://github.com/haad/proxychains

tar.gziped it, put it in base64, put it in a bash file,
and place them on the system for use.

It may be an interesting excesice in bash scripting for some,
but it's just for basic deployment when reverse-proxying servers for my own use.

To use, download install.sh and run or
```
